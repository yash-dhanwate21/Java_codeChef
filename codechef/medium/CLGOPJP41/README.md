## Problem

### Relational Operators

Relational operators help you compare two values or variables. They give you a result of either `true` or `false` based on the comparison.

#### Basic Comparison

Let's start with a simple example:

```
int height1 = 12;
int height2 = 14;
System.out.println(height1 < height2); // Outputs 1 (true) because 12 is less than 14

```

In this example, the `<` operator compares `height1` and `height2`. Since `height1` is less than `height2`, it returns `true`, represented by `true`.

#### Other Relational Operators

Here are some more examples of relational operators:

- a > b          (Checks if a is greater than b)
- a == b        (Checks if a is equal to b)
- a != b        (Checks if a is not equal to b)
- a >= b        (Checks if a is greater than or equal to b)
- a <= b        (Checks if a is less than or equal to b)
### Task
- You are given two variables height1 and height2.
- Output true if they are equal else false.
